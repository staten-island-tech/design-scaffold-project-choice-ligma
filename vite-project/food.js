        name: "All-Natural Shave Ice",
        description: "Hawaii’s iconic frozen treat is now part of the Islands’ farm-to-table movement. It’s becoming easier to get a bowl of finely shaved ice over which housemade, all natural, locally sourced syrups are generously poured. In many ways, this evolved shave ice recaptures the cool cones’ history. Japanese laborers, contracted to work in Hawaii sugar and pineapple fields, brought shave ice with them. Plantation workers would use their machetes to finely shave the ice from large ice blocks, then pour fruit juice over the fluffy ice.",

        name: "Poi",
        description: "The staple and traditional filler starch dish in Hawaiian cuisine is something known as poi. Poi is a thick paste made from taro root (similar to a yam or potato but with a starchy-er flavor) that is either steamed or baked and pounded. While pounding, water is added to the mixture to create a very sticky pudding-like consistency. Poi has a unique flavor, it’s starchy and slightly sour from the light fermentation in the preparation process.",
